# Unit 5.2 M3 Task 2


## Question 
Why is the load factor of a hash Table important. 

- as the load factor of your hash table increases, so does the likelihood of a collision, which reduces your hash table's perforrmance. It is important to monitor the load factor and resize your hash table when the load factor gets too large. 

- as the load factor of your hash table increases, so does the likelihood of a collision, which reduces your hash table's performance. When the load factor gets too large, you need to use a different data structure to store you data. 

- The load factor of a hash table is not importnat as long as you use a linked list to build you hash table. 

- as the load facotr of your hash table decreases, so does the likelihood of a collision, which causes your hash table's performance to get worse. It is importnat to monitor the load facotr and resize your hash table when the load factor gets too small. 

## Answer = 
as the load facotr of your hash table decreases, so does the likelihood of a collision, which causes your hash table's performance to get worse. It is importnat to monitor the load facotr and resize your hash table when the load factor gets too small.
